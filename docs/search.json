    "text": "Introduction\nThis project uses the Diabetes Health Indicators, which includes over 250,000 observations from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Each observation represents an individual and includes a variety of health-related variables:\n\nDiabetes_binary: Indicates whether the individual has been diagnosed with diabetes (our response variable)\nBMI: Body Mass Index\nPhysActivity: Whether the individual has engaged in physical activity in the last 30 days (not including job)\nHighBP: Whether the individual has high blood pressure\nThere are 18 more variables, but they will be excluded from this project for simplicity.\n\nThe goal of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to better understand the distribution and relationships between key health indicators and diabetes status. This includes examining individual variable distributions and how each potential predictor relates to the outcome.\nOur ultimate objective is to develop a model that can reasonably predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on these health indicators. By identifying meaningful patterns and associations during EDA, we aim to inform our modeling decisions and improve predictive accuracy. We will create 3 different types of models and select the best model from each model type. After that, we will compare these models and pick the overall best model.\nOur response variable will be Diabetes_binary and the 3 selected predictors are: BMI, PhysActivity, and HighBP. Studies have shown strong links between these variables and diabetes outcomes. For example, this article by Mokdad et al.Â (2005) published in Diabetes Care highlights how obesity and inactivity contribute significantly to the prevalence of diabetes. This article also mentions that blood pressure is connected to diabetes.\n\n\nData\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\n\n# Read in the data\ndiabetes_data &lt;- read.csv(\"diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv\")\n\n# Pick response and variables to be investigated and mutate them appropriately\ndiabetes_data &lt;- diabetes_data[, c(\"Diabetes_binary\", \"BMI\", \"PhysActivity\", \"HighBP\")] %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n    Diabetes_binary = factor(Diabetes_binary, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c(\"No Diabetes\", \"Diabetes\")),\n    PhysActivity = factor(PhysActivity, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\")),\n    HighBP = factor(HighBP, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\n  )\nhead(diabetes_data)\n\n  Diabetes_binary BMI PhysActivity HighBP\n1     No Diabetes  40           No    Yes\n2     No Diabetes  25          Yes     No\n3     No Diabetes  28           No    Yes\n4     No Diabetes  27          Yes    Yes\n5     No Diabetes  24          Yes    Yes\n6     No Diabetes  25          Yes    Yes\n\nsummary(diabetes_data)\n\n    Diabetes_binary        BMI        PhysActivity HighBP      \n No Diabetes:218334   Min.   :12.00   No : 61760   No :144851  \n Diabetes   : 35346   1st Qu.:24.00   Yes:191920   Yes:108829  \n                      Median :27.00                            \n                      Mean   :28.38                            \n                      3rd Qu.:31.00                            \n                      Max.   :98.00                            \n\n#check for missing values\nany(is.na(diabetes_data))\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nExcellent!
